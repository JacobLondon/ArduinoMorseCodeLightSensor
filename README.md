# MorseCodeLightSensor
A morse code reader implemented on a PIC18F4321.

# C Implementation
A Morse code reader implemented in C through a console application where the user can input series of 0's or 1's and an enter keypress.

# Arduino Implementation
The C implementation controlled with a photoresistor and a repeating timer on an Arduino, outputting converted 0's and 1's to ascii letters on the serial monitor.

# PIC18F4321 Implementation
The Arduino implementation modified to work on the PIC outputting to a Hitachi LCD display with a button to control word endings and an LED to indicate when input will be read.
